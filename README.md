```

## Standard Git Commands

bit clone https://github.com/user/repo
bit checkout -b feature
bit add .
bit commit -m "changes"
bit push origin feature
```

## Extensions

### Fs - Virtual Filesystem

Mount any commit as a filesystem with lazy blob loading:

```moonbit
let fs = Fs::from_commit(fs, ".git", commit_id)
let files = fs.readdir(fs, "src")
let content = fs.read_file(fs, "src/main.mbt")
```

### Kv - Distributed KV Store

Git-backed key-value store with Gossip protocol sync:

```moonbit
let db = Kv::init(fs, fs, git_dir, node_id)
db.set(fs, fs, "users/alice/profile", value, ts)
db.sync_with_peer(fs, fs, peer_url)
```

### Collab - Git-Native Collaboration

Pull Requests and Issues stored as Git objects:

```moonbit
let collab = Collab::init(fs, fs, git_dir)
let pr = collab.create_pr(fs, fs, "Fix bug", "...",
  source_branch, target_branch, author, ts)
```

## Build from Source

```bash
moon build --target native
just install
```
